First off, CCNA stands for *Cisco Certified Network Associate*. I will be using the following [course playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ) on YouTube, this course is based on the previous iteration of the CCNA which was released in February of 2020, and became deprecated in 2024 as version 1.1 of the CCNA 200-301 exam was released. The changes made between the two iterations are minor; the v1.1 exam updates are reflective of the increasing focus on cloud, automation, and AI in networking. As per [the syllabus](obsidian://open?vault=CCNA&file=Attachments%2F200-301-CCNA-v1.1.pdf), these changes pertain to domain 6. Further reading might be required when I get to it.

Also, the course used does not seem to have an identical structure to the syllabus, as such, the split between the six folders does not reflect the course content 1-to-1. Be aware of that. That said, it is clear that the course itself goes over all the material.

Also important to note that I will not be making comprehensive notes on everything as there is a large amount of information that is already known to me.
