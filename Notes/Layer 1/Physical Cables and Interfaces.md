These are all RJ-45 cables used to connect different nodes together in a network using a wired connection.

Data travelling across these wires relies on Ethernet, which is a collection of network protocols and standards. The bandwidth over physical connections is measured in bits per second, not bytes per second. This makes sense as the line can either be high or low only. Here are some copper Ethernet cables and their speeds:

802.3 seems like the IEEE standard for Ethernet. The informal names have different components, let us take 10BASE-T for example:
- 10: speed in Mbps
- BASE: [baseband signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseband) (beyond the scope of the CCNA)
- T: twisted pair cables

Ethernet cables are UTPs or Unshielded Twisted Pair. The twisting protects against electromagnetic interference, the twists in question refer to 2 or 4 pairs of twisted wires, with the slower standards 10Base-T and 100Base-T having 2 pairs and the 1000Base-T as well as 10GBase-T using 4 pairs.

The 2 pairs that are used in 10 and 100Base-T cables are:

with the other pins not being used, even though they are physically present on the RJ-45 jack.

Since the TX and RX pin pairs are separate, full-duplex communication is possible. full duplex meaning the transmission and reception can happen at the same time without any collisions happening.

Note that in the above diagram, the two devices (a PC and switch) do not send nor receive data on the same pins; a PC sends data on pins 1 and 2, whilst the switch receives data on pins 1 and 2, similarly, a PC receives data on 3 and 4 whilst the switch transmits data using those pins of the Ethernet cable. a router, functions the same as a PC:

The kinds of cables needed for connecting a PC to a switch, or router to a switch are straight-through cables; called that as they connect pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, etc... For a PC to switch or router to switch connection, this is perfect because switches receive data on the pins that a PC and router uses to send data and vice versa. If you wanted to connect two switches, two routers, or two PCs together, both devices would be trying to send and receive data on the same pins making communication impossible. Thus, you would need a different cable called a *crossover cable* which is wired liked this:

switches are the only devices which receive data on pins 1 and 2 and transmit using 3 and 6, whilst other network nodes follow the convention of a PC or router (for example a firewall).

In the modern day, this is no longer an issue due to a functionality called **Auto MDI-X** which allows network devices to detect what their neighbors are using to transmit and receive data and internally adjust which pins they use to transmit and receive data so that it matches.

Higher speed copper Ethernet cables use all 4 pairs, and have one distinct difference which is that all cables are bidirectional.

The next evolution of cabling is fiber optics, these cables are faster and can be extended for longer distances than the 100 meters offered by copper cables. These require special plugs on your switches and routers and a special adapter called a SFP or Small Formfactor Pluggable. The cables and adapter look like this:

The two lines in the cable are used for transmission and reception of data.

A cross section of the wire:

Of these fiber optics, there are two types:
- multi-mode fiber:
	- Core diameter is wider
	- Allows for multiple angles (modes) of light waves to enter core
	- Shorter maximum length than the single-mode fiber
	- Cheaper than single mode fiber due to cheaper LED transmitters
- single-mode fiber:
	- Narrower core
	- Allows for a single angle (mode) to enter
	- longer maximum length than a multi-mode fiber
	- more expensive due to laser based transmitters.

Comparing the two kinds of cables;

UTP:
- Cheaper
	- cable itself is cheaper
	- RJ-45 port is cheaper than a SPF
- Smaller maximum length of wire
- prone to EMI
- can leak information due to faint electromagnetic signal generated by electricity running through wire

Fiber-optic:
- More expensive:
	- cable itself is expensive
	- SPF is more expensive as well
- larger maximum length of cable
- not prone to EMI
- Does not leak data
